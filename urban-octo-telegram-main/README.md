Code Refactor Starter Code

The project was completed along the guidelines for UCLA Extension's Module 1 Challenge.

The webpage meets accessibility standards. The source code is organized logically with elements, tags, and attributes. Each of the images holds an alt attribute in the case of a missing image. The heading attributes fall in sequential order from h1 to h3. The title element contains a concise, descriptive title for the page.
